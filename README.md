## How to install manually:
You need to place the mod in a folder where BepInEx plugins are.

We recommend using [R2ModMan launcher](https://thunderstore.io/c/enter-the-gungeon/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or launching mods.
Here is how to install everything:
1. First of all - install required dependencies from thunderstore, shown on a website you are currently on. (make sure to download the right versions!)
2. Download mod using "Manual Download" button.
3. Go to "C:\Users\\<User\>\AppData\Roaming\r2modmanPlus-local\ETG\profiles\\<Profile from R2ModMan\>\BepInEx\plugins"
4. Create new folder for a mod here (for example: "plugins\Sandling Invasion" folder)
5. Extract all the files in newly created folder.
6. **Important**! Move "sprites" folder from "...\\<ModName\>\plugins\\\*" in "...\\<ModName\>\\\*" (up, in a folder hierarchy), to overwrite dogo sprites. 

Now, if dependencies are installed - all done!
You can launch the game via launcher.
